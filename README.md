# Form Creation Practice

The main purpose of this project is to practive building verbose forms which is user-friendly.

The form updates on every key stroke and only alerts the user of an invalid input onBlur. Afterwards it checks for validity on every keystroke so once the input is valid, the form input will return to normal.

This combines the usecases of onChange, onBlur and form submission.

It is also a practice for building custom hooks to avoid repetition of input validation and state logic.
